# Random-Choice-Picker
A **Random Choice Picker** that selects one of the things you input into the text-area separated by commas. <br><br>
When you input your choices and press enter you will see an animation that visually shows you how the choices are being randomly selected by highlighting and unhighlighting the choices. <br><br>
Finally, only one option remains highlighted which indicates the end result.<br><br>
The demo is live at *https://therealrajan.github.io/Random-Choice-Picker/*
